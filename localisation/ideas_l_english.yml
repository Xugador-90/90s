Our citizens have been grateful for this power, yet the rural regions continue to resent the government for giving the city dwellers prefferental treatment... 1\nElectrification is a simple concept in gameplay terms.

For some incomprehensible reason, the newest generation of our populace are becoming nothing more than punks and rabble rousers. They are completely disrespectful towards the ideals and traditions of the past, joining music groups that could make one deaf, believing that their needs and desires must go above all else (like the current law enforcement), and the college drop out rates within the nation have skyrocketed.

In 1989, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but it was very hard to prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.\"\n- Vojislav Šešelj on leader of criminal clique, Arkan"
