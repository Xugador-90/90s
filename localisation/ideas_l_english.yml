However, ever since the passing of the Electrification bill in 1962, some areas of America have been blessed with power, most notably the coastal cities, thanks to the rich coal reserves of Pennsylvania. Our citizens have been grateful for this power, yet the rural regions continue to resent the government for giving the city dwellers prefferental treatment... 1\nElectrification is a simple concept in gameplay terms. The more you do it, the more your citizenry will be greateful. §RBut if you take away their power, the memories of old will start to comeback, and like any person who has expierienced trauma, the citizenry will need there catharthis.§!"

However, should, say, a war force it to whip it into shape, it might become one of the most powerful armed forces not only in America, but the world..."

The servants of Satan had also broken into the Red Temples on the south-west, where Dead Blood of the Earth was removed, giving space for circulation of New Blood. Dead Blood is useful, yet the sons of Erlik don't know temperance, so all the Earth's blood is now sucked out, with no reason or limit, based on a pure urge to acquire more.

Their names were Kerey, Yabash and Temir, and yet they did not call themselves that way and tried to persecute the ones who did, the Faithful Ones knew their trickery and were brave enough to call them out. And the brothers were like pieces of a big key, which opens a complex lock, yet the lock did not contain treasure, but Sin, and the key will continue to pick locks around the earth until the Righteous Polkom separates the pieces of the key, or, what shall end it for ever and ever, throws the key back into the gates of Hell.\"\n— a Tale about the Enslavement of the Steppe by Karash, 1995"

And they had defaced it with monstrous cubes, and teared down what bright and living remained there, and made the sole purpose of whoever remained there to work to live and work to die there, serving not the Lord, but them and only them. But the Lord opposed it, and sent thick mist, even thicker than from the Isle of Despair itself, to reconquer the Land that was promised to the Reds and expel the servants of Satan, turning what they now call Tamag back to the plains. The servants, evil and proud they are, now wear suits akin to the full armor of God to protect themselves from the mist, yet the Lord will win over them, and soon or late his judgement will come!\"\n— from the Damnation of the Steppe, 1993"
