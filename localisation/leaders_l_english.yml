POLITICS_MICHAEL_DUKAKIS_DESC:0 "Michael Dukakis was born on November 3rd, 1933, to a pair of well-off doctors who had immigrated to America in 1912. A mere college kid at the young age of 27 when the bombs went off. Like all college, kids, Dukakis was a staunch supporter of President Eisenhower, and despised Patton, Wallace, and Ford for their betrayl of America during the collapse. It was the combination of this bitter hatred and a gifted intellect that won Dukakis his House seat in 1961, by then a respected and competant physican, awell as member of the community. While a Representitive, Dukakis urged the passing of the Federal Electrification bill, being hailed as one of the founding members of the Federal Electrification Agency, or FEA. It was when the people of Massachusetts finally had light in there homes that won him his Governor seat in 1966. As Governor, Dukakis became what can essentially be called the Messiah of Massachusetts, as his policies created a standard of life unparralled in that state since the collapse, with not only Electricity, but televisons and phone lines. After 20 years of incredibly managment, Dukakis was able to get the republician nomination for the President of the United, and then the President. As Dukakis nears the end of his his first term, things have begun to look up, the FEA was expanded to not only include the Urban hubs like New York and Philaedelphia, but to a majority of the American coastline, including Norfolk. Water treatment was first re-introduced to New York and Philaedelphia in 1988, and since then Dukakis seeks to expand it to all of America. When asked about his personal ideology, he simply responded with \"American\". In foreign policy Dukakis seeks to §Rreunify the nation at all costs, and is willing and hoping to force the traitors that stole America to come to heel.§!. He has not come without oppisition however, as the SDPA has critized his Federal Administrations as being Anti-Worker, with them being little better than the old companies that preceded them, but so far their critisisms have fallen on death ears. As the 1992 election comes to ahead, it seems all but ensured that Dukakis wins the next election, but things have been shown to change very rapidly before..."

XIN_ISA_YUSUF_ALPTEKIN_DESC:0 "Yusuf Isa Alpetkin, the monarch of the Xinjiang Sultanate, is revered as a savior by some, feared as a tyrant by others, and is shrouded in mystery for all. Born in the dying years of the Qing Dynasty, in the region which he would eventually come to rule over, the young Alpetkin first rose to notability when he arrived in Nanjing as a representative of the short lived First East Turkestan Republic to the then dominant nationalist KMT. After finishing his job, he stayed in Nanjing until 1937, when Japanese imperialists descended onto the city. Fearful for his life, Alpetkin fled with the KMT to Chongqing. From here on out, Alpetkin toured the Middle East with other Uyghur diplomats attempting to secure aid for the Nationalist government, with varying success. \n\nAsWorld War 2 came to a close and the chances of a independent Xinjiang once again reemerged, Alpetkin tried to counter the Communist government of the Second East Turkestan Republic with requests to the Nationalists for the backing of a Islamic buffer state to the USSR as well as Communist China; like efforts before this one fell through and Alpetkin fled Xinjiang as the PLA incorporated the province into the newly founded Peoples Republic. \n\nAlpetkin settled in Turkey, where his ideological beliefs would become shaped by the leader of the notorious Nationalist Movement Party, Alparslan Turkes. Alpetkin kept an eye on the steadily deteriorating situation in China as he gathered supporters and supplies for a potential final return to the place where he grew up. When civil war broke out in 1975, Alpetkin and his small but well supplied and motivated group of followers slipped their way to Uruqmi, where the PRC was withdrawing out of following the mass exodus of Chinese to coastal provinces. Alpetkin used the following chaos to declare a Xinjiang Sultanate based on the principles of an Islamic government and the unity of the Turkic peoples at least in that region, and by 1983 the region had been marked by a growing splendid isolation as the rest of China and the world fell into conflict and chaos. \n\nNow, it is 1991, and Alpetkin knows one thing - he doesn't have much time in the Dunya left. Enemies new and old seek to reunify China. Can Alpetkin and his successors keep Xinjiang out of the coming storm, or will Xinjiang fall once again to more ambitious men?"
CWU_BO_YIBO_DESC:0 "Bo Yibo has been noted as one of the most steadfast players in the politics of the Chinese Workers Union by his peers. Born in 1908 to a craftsman, his family was so swamped by economic hardships, that they were forced to drown one of Bo's newborn brothers to avoid the costs that would come with raising and feeding him, and the memory of this event would haunt Bo throughout his entire life. After joining the Communist Party as an organizer in his native city of Taiyuan, Bo would slowly rise up through the ranks of the Party while living through all the conflicts that would plague China; the Chinese Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese Civil War, and the consolidation of the Communist regime after 1949. \n\nWith the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Bo Yibo was beginning to fear that Mao's senility would have a destabilizing effect on China. These fears were shared by other members of the CPC, including one Marshal Peng Duhai, who would eventually contact Yibo to become part of an anti-Mao clique that would overthrow Mao, end Chinese involvement overseas, and normalize relationships with the Soviet Union. Bo agreed, and by 1975 the clique made their move. \n\nHowever, Mao would escape to label Peng and his gang of revisionists traitors, and China would be launched into a second civil war. Bo could only watch as what he worked for all his life was destroyed by a leader whose fanaticism knew no boundaries. Peace would be made in the 80s, but this made no difference because China was once again in ruins. \n\nWhen Peng died in 1976, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Chinese Workers Union initially elected to have collective leadership, and Bo was not opposed to this. However, a tragic assasination of two senior figures- Peng Zhen and Deng Xiaoping-in 1987 threw the CPCWU into chaos. At the official Third National Congress of the CPCWU, the Central Committee chose to dismantle collective leadership and elect Bo as General Commissioner. Since then, Bo Yibo has held the reins of power within the Chinese Workers Union. Can he solve the issues plaguing it, and lead the reunification effort with resolute firmness? Or will his age get the best of him, like it did to Mao?"
PRC_ZHANG_CHUNQIAO_DESC:0 PRC_ZHANG_CHUNQIAO_DESC:0 "Zhang Chunqiao, the current leader of the Maoist remnant known as the People's Republic of China, has always been committed to propagating and defending the ideology of his predecessor. Born in the prefectural level city of Heze in Shandong province, Zhang would emerge as a writer in Shanghai, becoming closely affiliated with the city as a result. Zhang would join the Communist Party of China at the Yan'an Conference in 1938 and became, henceforth, a steadfast defender of its leader, Chairman Mao. \n\nWhen Mao launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Zhang hopped on board as a steadfast defender of the change it would bring to China, even forming the Shanghai Commune alongsides hardliner Communists like Yao Wenyuan and Weng Hongwen, with whom he would later form the infamous Gang of Four. \n\nIn 1975, Marshal Peng Duhai and other moderate Party leaders, fearing that Mao was no longer capable of leading China, led a coup to oust him. The Second Chinese Civil War had beuan. Zhang, alongside the Gang of Four, were elevated to leadership positions within the CPC, but due to their newfound power, a split began to emerge inside the Gang and the Party. When Mao died in 1978, Jiang Qing, Weng Hongwen, and Xu Xiangao, a senior commander in the Revolutionary Red Guards Army Corps, attempted to wrestle control from the dominant faction who were against any sort of negotiations and withdrawal from Korea, which is still occupied by the PRC. Outraged, Zhang ordered elite squads handpicked by Mao himself at the start of the civil war to arrest the leaders of this capitulationist faction.Weng, Xu, and Jiang Qing were all caught and summarily executed, leaving Zhang as the de facto ruler of the PRC. Afterwards, Zhang consolidated power, continuing the policies of Mao Zedong, the Eternal Chairman. \n\nZhang and his close ally Yao Wenyuan technically have complete control of the PRC, but in reality not all is orderly. The recent assassination of the military commander of the Korean occupation has sparked a mass wave of violence from the Red Guards towards the Korean population, which seems poised to spill into the PRC itself. The backlash from the guerillas there will surely cause trouble for the occupation, and Zhang is starting to suspect, for the People's Republic itself."

TEM_ERLIK_KHAN_DESC:0 "\"...And then, the Lord heard the sinful screams of the Red Soil, and send one man, corrupted by sinful greed and devoured by unholy wrath, to unite the Godless foreigners. The man clenched the formerly scattered demons of the Steppe into one, and took three other sinful men as his brothers to stand on his throne, and then they took the keys to temples of Aktobe, and started draining the blood of the soil from there, and the Righteous felt only grief because nothing would work against the vermin, and along with the Devil's appearance, dust came, subduing the land more. And the Red Polkoms commanded seventy-two Bogatyrs and the Great Polkom Kalausha Adilkhanovich to put an end to the menace, yet the Polkoms and the Bogatyrs and the Great Polkom Kalausha laid their bones near Charyn, where the great battle commenced, because no one understood the sins that we had committed before our Lord, and there will be no peace on the Steppe unless the peoples clear out the sin in their hearts and minds. Until then, Polkoms will die, and the cursed dust shall suffocate the Almatians, and Semipalatians, and Askhabadis, and anyone who shall come to the damned land.\"\n— a Tale about the Enslavement of the Steppe by Karash, 1995"
